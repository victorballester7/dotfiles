# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for my [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org) setup. To install them, run the following commands:

```
./installer.sh
```

And to copy the configuration files to the correct location, run:

```
./copyConfig.sh
```

:::note
In order to access certain recursive-browser features in `rofi` from a folder inside OneDrive, create a link from that folder to `~/Desktop` or another folder that is not inside `OneDrive`. This way you will be able to access the files from `rofi` without any issues.
